# [Tweelyzer](https://tweelyser.herokuapp.com)

A `Flask` web-app to display analytics based on a particular users' Twitter profile.
User can analyse any profile for public data, as permitted by Twitter REST API (which restricts access to protected accounts).

The number of API requests are limited within a time-frame. It is therefore requested to generate your own API key from [Twitter developer site](https://developer.twitter.com).

For contributing, a basic initial setup is required to contribute to this `Flask` project.

    git clone https://github.com/himanshub16/tweelyser.git
    cd tweelyser
    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

Run the `app.py` file any time you want to test the app.


#### Disclaimer
* The analysis is based on latest 200 tweets, to avoid slowing down while fetching data from Twitter. 
* The data is fetched from Twitter API. The developer claim no responsibility of any interpretations, misuse, validity of this data.
* The privacy and security is handled by Twitter. Your personal data is not stored.
### A better and more practical version of this project is [Analytics by Twitter](https://analytics.twitter.com).
Please use that for practical purposes.
